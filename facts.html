<h2>10 facts about Rugby:</h2>
    <p>
      
            1) Origin: Rugby originated in England in the early 19th century when a student named William Webb Ellis at Rugby School allegedly picked up the ball during a football (soccer) game and ran with it, thus creating a new game that would later be known as rugby.

            2) Rugby World Cup: The Rugby World Cup is the premier international rugby union competition. The tournament was first held in 1987 and has since become one of the largest and most prestigious sporting events in the world, rivaling even soccer's FIFA World Cup in terms of global viewership.

            3) Two Main Variants: There are two main variants of rugby: Rugby Union and Rugby League. While they share many similarities, they also have some distinct rules and characteristics, such as the number of players on the field and the scoring system.

            4) Scrum: One of the most iconic elements of rugby is the scrum, where players from both teams pack closely together and try to gain possession of the ball using their feet. It's a physically demanding and strategic aspect of the game.

            5) Try, Conversion, Penalty, and Drop Goal: Rugby has several ways to score points. A "try" is worth five points and occurs when a player touches the ball down behind the opponent's goal line. After a try, the scoring team has the opportunity to kick a conversion for two extra points. Penalty kicks and drop goals are also ways to score points.

            6) No Forward Passing: Unlike American football, players in rugby cannot pass the ball forward. They can only pass it laterally or backward, which adds a unique tactical dimension to the game.

            7) Positions: Rugby has specific positions for players with different skills and roles on the field, such as props, hookers, locks, flankers, scrum-halves, fly-halves, centers, wings, and fullbacks.

            8) Haka: The New Zealand national rugby team, known as the All Blacks, performs the Haka, a traditional Maori war dance, before their matches. It's a powerful and intimidating ritual meant to psych up the players and intimidate the opposition.

            9) Rugby Sevens: Rugby Sevens is a variant of rugby union in which teams consist of seven players instead of the usual fifteen. It's a faster-paced and more open version of the game, often played in tournaments such as the Olympics and the Rugby World Cup Sevens.

            10) Spirit of the Game: Rugby is renowned for its strong sense of sportsmanship and camaraderie. Players are expected to uphold values such as respect, integrity, solidarity, passion, and discipline, which are encapsulated in the "Spirit of Rugby."
